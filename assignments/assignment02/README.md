This project aims to gives force the player to recognizes the different agencies than its own. The project shows the goal
of the user, the programmer and the program itself. The user want typically to beat the game he is presented to. 
The programmer, me, wish you would make the wrong choice so the player would get experience all the suprised I have prepared 
for him. Futhermore, the game itself have an agency wish is for the player to follow its narrative. The program made the game 
more and more difficult, annoying and obvious that the player have no say in the story.

Originally, the game was plan as a dialog between me and the players, by using the abusive design theory, but found out that
the relationship that the player have with the game coule be rather interesting. That is why I created the game to give an
illusion of direct communication with the player, by creating an annoying narrator that call everybody 'Steve'. To create
a better interaction between the narrator and the player I used different javascript techniques to annoy the player, like a
test subject that would get shocked everytime he/she made a bad descision. I, also, uses a voice library for the narrator
voice because I thought this robotic emotionless voice would be easily link to a machine, thus the narrator talking.

The abusive aspect of the game highlights another aspect of games and programs in general. Although they're aim to give the
the user a feeling of freedom, the user is always limited to the option the program is made to give. In this game the player
is constantly given at least 2 options but only one can truly makes him progress through the game. 

This game is inspired by Davey Wreden and William Pugh's game 'The Stanley Parable', but aim to an opposite message. Where
'The Stanley Parable' aims to give the player as much freedom as possible to break the linear narative of games, I wish to
highlight it.

This project is not only revelant to games, although it uses this format, but to our relationship with programs and IA in
general as we build more and more interaction with those machines that are still limited and offer only limited possibilities.
As a designer it would be intersting to see the evolution of this array of possibilities that the programs could offer us.
